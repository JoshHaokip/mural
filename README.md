# MURAL

www.joshhaokip.com/mural-design

Recently I have designed and created a website template called ‘Mural’ which was made for local businesses who are in need of assistance with regards to their online presence, especially in light of what is currently happening. 

This is only a template as my plan is to consult with businesses to create a product backlog of features they would like to include such as a google maps integration. 

This was built using **HTML** and **CSS** with [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Anima](https://www.animaapp.com/) to design and prototype. I was able to work on my knowledge of responsive design and experiment with media queries to create a mobile friendly website. 

**My Process:** 

1. Initially, I drew the design with pen and paper

2. Used Sketch to design and Anima to create prototypes 

3. Planned out the structure of the site on a whiteboard
