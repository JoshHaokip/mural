# MURAL

www.joshhaokip.com/mural

Recently I have designed and created a website template called ‘Mural’ which was made for local businesses who are in need of assistance with regards to their online presence, especially in light of what is currently happening. 

This is only a template as my plan is to consult with businesses to create a product backlog of features they would like to include such as a google maps integration. 

This was built using HTML and CSS with Sketch and Anima to design and prototype. 

**My Process:** 

1. Initially, I drew the design with pen and paper

2. Used sketch to create prototypes with anima.co 

3. Planned out the structure of the site on a whiteboard
